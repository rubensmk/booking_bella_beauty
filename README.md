# 💇‍♀️ Beauty Booking System

This is a multi-tenant booking system MVP for beauty centers. Each center has its own landing page and list of services available for booking.

## 🧑‍💻 Running the App Locally

```bash
# 1. Clone the project
git clone https://github.com/your-username/beauty-booking.git
cd beauty-booking

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Create the environment variables file
cp .env.example .env.local

# .env.local
API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000

# 4. Run the development server
npm run dev

# Visit http://localhost:3000/bella_beauty
```

## 🧠 Technical Decisions

- **Next.js (App Router + Server Components)**: enabled hybrid rendering, with SEO-friendly Server Components and client-side interactivity.
- **TailwindCSS**: for rapid, utility-first styling with a custom beauty-oriented color palette.
- **API Routes with Mock Data**: `/api/services` provides mock service data and simulates network latency.
- **Artificial Delay**: 1.5-second delay added on the server to mimic real-world API response time.
- **Client-Side Modal Logic**: booking modal uses `useState` and conditional rendering to manage visibility and success states.

## ✅ Implemented Validations

- All fields (name, email, date, time) are required.
- Date and time inputs must represent a valid future datetime.
- Client-side feedback for validation errors and success state.
- Booking confirmation displays all inputted details and selected service info.

## ⏱️ Total Time Invested

**~5 hours**

## 🛠️ Features I Would Add with More Time

- ✅ Real backend with database persistence (e.g. PostgreSQL + Prisma).
- ✅ Admin dashboard to view and manage bookings.
- ✅ Authentication and role-based access (e.g. center owner login).
- ✅ Calendar/time slot availability per service.
- ✅ Email notifications for users and center admins.
- ✅ i18n for multi-language support.
- ✅ Improved accessibility and Lighthouse score.
- 🤖 **AI Chat Booking Assistant**: integrate a conversational interface using AI (e.g. OpenAI API) to allow clients to schedule appointments via natural language chat.


## 🤖 AI Tools Used

### 1. **ChatGPT (OpenAI)**  
Used to assist with:
- Project scaffolding and Tailwind/Next.js setup
- Structuring this README and refining technical writing

### 2. **Lovable (AI design tool)**  
Used for:
- Visual inspiration and layout references
- Generating component mockups and beauty-oriented UI sections

### ✅ Pros
- Greatly reduced setup and boilerplate time
- Helped maintain design consistency and modern UX patterns

### ⚠️ Cons
- Code generated by **Lovable** often includes multiple external libraries unnecessarily, which can lead to overengineering or confusion.
- It's important to carefully review AI-generated code, as not all suggestions make sense in the context of your project or stack.
